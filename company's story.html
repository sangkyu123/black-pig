<pre>One day my first brother told me "Why don't you learn about computer coding?".
Computer coding alone couldn't atrract me because i have no care about it. but i didn't have any job then, so i told him that i want.
He introduced me the computer coding with a site for amatuar called 'Life Coding'.
I challenged coding with site's lectures. First of step, i'm excited just one thing that lecturer told me "Imagine that you're a engineer."
So, i started making website as soon as possible.
Therefore this company is erected in 2017. </pre>
